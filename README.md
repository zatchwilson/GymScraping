# GymScraping
This script will scrape the data the University of Utah publishes for the Student Life center, and will insert the data into a new sqlite entry.

NOTE: The user must have their own 'app.log' file and must have their own 'testDB.db' in order for this to successfully work. In order to make it efficient, the user may also want to setup an automated task with Window's Scheduler, or the equivelent for Mac/Linux.
